# CodeAlpha-EDA
📌 Project Overview

This project is part of an internship task and consists of two main phases:

Task 1 – Web Scraping

Collected product data from an e-commerce website.

Extracted key information such as product name, price, rating, and category.

Saved the data into a structured format (CSV file).

Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed the scraped dataset.

Explored data structure, trends, and anomalies.

Created visualizations to better understand the data.

Highlighted insights and potential issues for future improvements.

🎯 Objectives

Collect structured product data through web scraping.

Explore dataset content using EDA techniques.

Identify trends, anomalies, and data quality issues.

Build visualizations for better understanding.

Prepare the dataset for advanced analytics.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python 3

BeautifulSoup4 / Requests (for scraping)

Pandas (for data manipulation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (for analysis)

📊 Steps Performed
🔹 Web Scraping (Task 1)

Connected to the website using requests.

Parsed HTML structure with BeautifulSoup.

Extracted product details (name, price, rating, category).

Exported data to CSV.

🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (Task 2)

Data Overview

Dataset shape, columns, and datatypes.

Checked for missing values and duplicates.

Descriptive Statistics

Summary statistics for numerical features.

Distribution of product prices.

Data Visualization

Histograms for price distribution.

Boxplots for outlier detection.

Countplots for categorical features.

Correlation heatmap for numerical variables.

Insights & Findings

Outliers detected in product pricing.

Missing values in some attributes.
